<h2>Timeline of Srinivasa Ramanujan’s Life:</h2>
<ul id="tribute-info">
<li>1887 - Born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. Raised in Kumbakonam, where he demonstrated early signs of genius, particularly in mathematics.
</li>
<li>1904 - At 16, Ramanujan obtains a copy of George Carr's A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a compilation of 5,000 theorems, which he devours. This book serves as his mathematical bible and inspires his own explorations.</li>
<li>1909 - Ramanujan marries Janaki Ammal. While struggling with poverty, he continues to pursue mathematics obsessively, writing down original results without formal proofs.
</li>
<li>1911 - Publishes his first paper on Bernoulli numbers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. Despite lacking formal education, his work starts to attract attention in academic circles in India.
</li>
<li>1913 - Writes a letter to the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy, enclosing several of his groundbreaking theorems, many of which are completely new to Western mathematicians. Hardy, amazed by the depth and originality of the work, invites Ramanujan to Cambridge University.</li>
<li>1914 - Travels to England, where he begins collaborating with Hardy. Together, they produce several important results, including Ramanujan’s famous partition formula, Ramanujan-Hardy number theory, and work on infinite series.</li>
<li>1916 - Earns a Bachelor of Science degree from Cambridge University for his work in mathematics, despite having no formal college education prior to this.</li>
<li>1918 - Ramanujan is elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, one of the youngest in history and the first Indian to achieve this honor. Later, he becomes a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
</li>
<li>1919 - Due to illness, likely worsened by England's harsh climate and poor wartime conditions, Ramanujan returns to India. His health continues to decline, but he continues working on mathematics until his final days.</li>
<li>1920 - Dies at the age of 32 from complications related to tuberculosis and malnutrition. Despite his short life, Ramanujan leaves behind an enormous legacy, with over 3,900 formulas, many of which continue to inspire mathematicians.</li>
<li>2012 - Ramanujan’s lost notebook, which contains unpublished results, is discovered decades after his death. These results prove to be fundamental to modern mathematics.
</li>
</ul>
